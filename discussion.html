In our HASS findings, we considered Adam Smith’s “Wealth of Nations” and the ideas of Clifford Geertz.&nbsp;<br><br>Through Smith, we looked at themes relating to the fundamentals of economies, fair governance, and education. This led us to look at the problem of undernourishment from an economic standpoint. Smith’s ideas point towards the education in African countries as well as improving their market system.<br><br>Through Geertz’ lens, we looked at the uniqueness and individuality of cultures in Africa and how they might have caused the problem of undernourishment. Geertz’ ideas led us to dive deeper into the specific cultures in Africa. With his ideas in mind, we look at how changing their culture could aid in decreasing the prevalence of undernourishment in African countries.<br><br>We conclude that Geertz’ lens supported our findings better – as stated above and shown in our data, it seems that the prevalence of undernourishment is predicted by different metrics for each country. Hence, Geertz’ idea of understanding the uniqueness of each country’s culture and how it might help us address nourishment is helpful and fitting here.<br><br>Hence, Geertz is more relevant to resolving the social concerns in our problem.&nbsp;<br>While both Smith and Geertz lens point towards education – Smith’s conclusion does not support his belief in the free market – while Geertz’s ideas of approaching the issue via deep diving into their culture is far more applicable.<br><br>Our solution here is thus highly contextualised aid – one that provides them food directly but also educate them about how their cultural norms are detrimental to their nourishment and well-being. Large emphasis should be placed into understanding their cultural norms deeply, knowing where they come from, and addressing how it might be detrimental to them.<br></p></div><div class="container"><p class="fs-3"><strong>Model Evaluation</strong></p><div style="height: 600px;background: url(&quot;assets/img/cost_function_against_iterations.png&quot;) center / contain no-repeat;border-radius: 16px;"></div><p style="padding-left: 16px;">The cost function as shown from above approaches an asymptote close to 0 as the number of iterations increases to 1500.

This asserts the accuracy of our model. It is however, not so effective in predicting the prevalence of nourishment in Namibia, likely due to vastly different economic and cultural situations.<br></p></div><div class="container" style="margin-bottom: 200px;"><p class="fs-3"><strong>Analysis of Coefficients</strong></p><div style="background: url(&quot;assets/img/out_coeffs.png&quot;) center / contain no-repeat;border-radius: 16px;height: 200px;"></div><p style="padding-left: 16px;">For CPI (consumer price index), it shows a high variance across the beta values of the chosen countries, with the data values being generally in between about -1.5 to 1.5. As we used CPI as a gauge of inflation, it seems that our initial prediction that inflation would cause a higher PoU was somewhat validated. The boxplot shows that while CPI is correlated to PoU, each country manifests different results - some would see an increase in PoU when CPI rises while in others, a decrease in PoU instead. This supports our HASS research on Geertz, where each country is unique and thus would respond differently to changes in the economic environment.<br><br>CGDP (GDP per capita) and FI (Food imports per capita) show low variance and also a general distribution of beta values close to 0, with an outlier each. This shows that both of these metrics do not seem to affect the countries' PoU. This further reinforces our HASS research, where we examined Adam Smith and his ideas on wealth and market systems- here, it seems the general wealth of a country, linked to CGDP, has a weak correlation to PoU. Similarly, the weak correlation between FI and PoU in these countries show that PoU is not best addressed by examining their market system. Therefore it shows that Smith's ideas are largely unapplicable - we stick to Geertz to continue developing our solution based on the data.<br></p></div><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.11.1/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
