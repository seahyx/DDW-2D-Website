This led us to explore agricultural countries with food security in mind. Further investigation revealed that African countries suffer a greater degree of food insecurity - there is a much higher prevalence of undernourishment among citizens of African countries, about 4-20% from our Excel findings, than the global average of below 2.5%<a href="https://www.developmentaid.org/api/frontend/cms/file/2022/05/eighthipc_backgroundreport_english.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="View source" style="color: var(--bs-blue);width: 12px;height: 12px;margin-right: 2px;margin-left: 2px;">

We chose this group of low income people as the basis of our persona.<br><br>From our HASS findings, we discovered that Geertz' ideas were applicable to the problem, and diving deeper, we understood that there seems to be unique cultural norms that are pervasive, perhaps endemic, to that country, which contribute largely to the lack of social reform that would help decrease the prevalence of undernourishment in African countries.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div class="container" style="margin-bottom: 64px;"><p class="fs-3"><strong>User Persona - Gale</strong></p><p>We created a user persona for "Gale", someone living in an African country whose income is below the 3rd quantile. Being unable to afford the appropriate amount of food needed for him to be properly nourished, Gale suffers from undernourishment. To make things worse, Gale is the sole breadwinner of his family - he needs to feed his wife and his two young children.<br><br>Gale is a hardworking person but due to his circumstances of being born into peasantry with average education, a lack of family wealth, a lack of emphasis on education, and living in a society with low social mobility, he is unable to earn more. He has to make do with what he has - eating simply 1 or 2 meals a day as most of his income is spent on paying rent and bills, among many other expenses necessary for his own and his family's survival in society.<br></p><img width="100%" src="assets/img/user_persona_gale.jpg" style="border-radius: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;"><p>Gale does not particularly care about how much he eats - as long as his immediate hunger is staved off, he pays no mind - he is much more concerned about the well-being of his wife and his children.&nbsp;<br><br>However, the cultural norms within his country - where priority of eating is given to him, the sole breadwinner, before his dependents - causes issues within his family. His two young children were taught by his wife and their extended family to ensure that Gale has eaten enough first before they can eat. Gale understands that he does not have the power to change this, and simply eats until he feels filled and ensures that his family finishes the rest.&nbsp;<br><br>Furthermore, the quality of food that Gale and his family is also questionable - it is seen as more "cultured" and "modern" in Gale's society to consume the readily available processed foods as opposed to the locally grown produce that is much more nutritious. However, to be fair to the meagre earning power that Gale has, the nutritious locally grown produce is often more expensive than the canned processed foods available, as these local nutritious crops are sold overseas instead of used to feed the locals - ironically because the locals themselves don't want it.<br><br>Gale does not realise that his wife's and children's health are worsening as days go by - firstly, the quality of food that they eat is poor; secondly, the amount of food they can afford daily is only enough to stave off immediate hunger.<br></p><span>These cultural issues are steadily increasing his dependent's chances of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, especially in his children, stunting their growth and decreasing their cognitive capacity.<a href="https://www.developmentaid.org/api/frontend/cms/file/2022/05/eighthipc_backgroundreport_english.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="View source" style="margin-left: 8px;color: var(--bs-blue);">
